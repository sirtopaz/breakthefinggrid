        <h4>Statement</h4>
        <div>
          <p>My state of mind is torn between the direction of pursuing both a music career in California as well as graphic design specializing in branding and advertising. I’ve been writing songs since I was a senior in high school and started to transform my thoughts into pop songs by recording them for the world to hear. I was always told to ‘dream big’ and that’s exactly what I’m doing, but there are hiccups, critics, and people telling you ‘no’ along the way. I don’t believe in being satisfied with what people tell me I’m suppose to be satisfied with just because there are millions of other musicians who want the same thing as I do. Sometimes we don’t reach for the stars, and I don’t think that’s a healthy way to live. </p>
          <p>I’ve been bonding both directions of professions together throughout the years while learning so much about myself as a designer as well as a musician – being a young and aspiring artist, I want to set the example that it’s possible for people like me to step out on our own to make risks and achieve the things we want achieved.</p>
