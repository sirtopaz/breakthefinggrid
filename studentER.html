          <p>
            Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist. Now as much as I wish that I had written that quote myself it is derived from one of my favorite painters, Picasso. I believe hearing these words were the beginning of an artistic adventure that would come to define myself. Creating has never been about just making things, for me it is about producing a piece of any sort that can express who I am. Whether it was designing a logo, painting on a canvas, or even just photographing something with my phone; my art and designs are not so much about what I have taken in or learned, rather itâ€™s making people see the world with my eyes and my rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I came to the New England School of Art and Design in 2012, I knew that I was an artist and that I wanted to create for a living, but I did not yet know what it meant for me to be a designer. During these last four years, I have not only learned the technical terms and definitions of what it means to design, but I have also come to terms with the type of designer I want to be and what I want my work to reflect. When I graduate, I hope to pursue my interests in print as well as web based designs, but more importantly I hope to continue building my voice into an artist in addition to a designer.
