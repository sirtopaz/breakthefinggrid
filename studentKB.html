          <p>Hello! Thank you so much for stopping by to take a look at my work. I&rsquo;m Kari Belval from Vermont, and yes I&rsquo;ve chugged a mini jug of maple syrup in under a minute with no ill after effects. My road to Graphic Design has in no way been a straightforward one. I didn&rsquo;t even know the field existed until my sophomore year in college. I first came to Suffolk as a Marine Science major because I watched way too much Shark Week. By my third major change (after English and Communications) I accidentally signed up for a class called Design Lab that I just stayed in because I thought learning how to Photoshop dogs on anything I wanted an opportunity I couldn't refuse. I ended up loving the class and learned that Suffolk actually had a school of art. A few classes later and with my fourth and final major change I settled in here at NESAD forever grateful I somehow ended up at Suffolk&rsquo;s best kept secret. </p>
          <p>My rollercoaster of a ride here reminds me to always be open-minded. It also makes me excited (and slightly terrified) for whatever the future holds. &nbsp;I hope my work makes you laugh, smile, or bring you some sort of joy, that&rsquo;s always my intent and hope. Enjoy the show and check out my amazingly talented classmates as well! Also, the free alcohol is all the way down the hallway and to your right.</p>
