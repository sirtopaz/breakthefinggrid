        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <div>
          <p>My creative journey started long before coming to Boston, which is back home in Jamaica. Growing up in an artistic home with my father, a painter and now Business Manager of his own outdoor advertising company, my brother who is a Computer Engineer and Photographer and my sister also a Graphic Designer and it was hard not to follow their creative footsteps. </p>
          <p>At high schools in Jamaica, the art we learn focuses more around Fine Arts like drawing and painting. The use of computer graphics or even the concept of graphic design was not offered to us. I became to understand a little about what it was when my sister started attending a local art college to receive her graphic design degree. I would watch her do her projects by hand and by computer and I was intrigued by the design skills used. It was so different from the Fine Art way and I started using these methods in my own work for school by integrating typography and and simpler designs. This was when I knew I wanted to pursue being a graphic designer especially when I learned how to give myself clearer skin in photos with Photoshop’s Cloning Stamp and Healing Brush Tools.</p>
          <p>So why did I leave my summer season all year round? Design is different everywhere you go and I thought I would benefit a lot from learning from somewhere new. And Boston happened to be that city of opportunity for me. I only had very basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop until I came to NESAD. I’ve learned so many things here. The professors here as well as other students have helped me push myself to go beyond my limits. I love being creative and I’m always looking out for design inspiration wherever I go. I want to go into Print Advertising because I enjoy being able to see my work physically especially when I get to cut it, mount it, present it. Of courses there’s the headache of getting everything just right between start to finish for this process but that’s what makes me love it.</p>
