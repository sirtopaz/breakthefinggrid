            I’ve taken the long way ‘round to a design rebound. Being a lover of art, architecture and design for as long as I can remember, I’ve always had an interest in creative
            expression. However, for most of my life and career I followed my first passion &#8211; software engineering. As a long time web applications developer, I have
            worked closely with many designers to produce wonderful software that people use everyday. While I’ve mostly played the developer’s yang to the designer’s yin,
            there were a few times along the way when I was able to do design work. At those times, I felt something more than a passing interest &#8211; I thought I
            might have some aptitude for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few years ago, I decided to pursue an education in graphic design. I discovered that there was indeed something: a
            passion for design and a love for the creative process. I also discovered that I tended to have a slightly atypical perspective when designing because of my
            experience in software and engineering. While this may not be the typical   background for a graphic designer, I’ve found many parallels in the design and
            engineering processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an engineer, I understand how problem solving, decision-making and iterating produce fast, practical and robust
            software. As a designer, I understand how problem solving, decision-making and iterating produce strong, meaningful and compelling projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having learned some command of the graphic design language, I can see many new potential career opportunities becoming available.
            I would love to pursue pure design work and apply my experience in engineering to it. I will continue to pursue development work, but add my newly acquired
            design skills to the mix. As I continue to design and grow in my proficiency, I hope to see a balance forming. When I am a both designer and developer, the circle
            will be complete.
