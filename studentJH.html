        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            My story starts off like most artists you know. As a kid I was the typical quiet girl that kept to her self but always liked to express myself through arts and craft projects at school or day care. Looking back even as a child I am the same artist I am today. I was a little perfectionist and always pushed myself to go all out with my work and create something amazing, whether it was just a drawing or fuse beads, it had to be perfect. I couldnâ€™t just make something, I had to create and design something that I was really proud of.

            Then while attending the Blue Hills Regional Vocational School I found my calling for graphic design. Blue Hills is a trade school, and freshman year you try out a variety of these shop, then pick   what you will study for the next four years. I tried a variety of things from culinary to metal fabrication to engineering. I was actually really good when I tested to electrical trade, and almost decided go forward with that trade!. My life could have ben so different. Or I could have listened to my mom and went into engineering (eye roll). But I know what my calling was and wanted to do with designing and creating. At first I was star stuck with the Graphics trade program, which was the print and production side of the design world. It was so fun with design a shirt or notebook cover then physically create my design off the computer and bring it to life. However, then I had my week in the Design and Visual Communication trade program and I knew this was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.
