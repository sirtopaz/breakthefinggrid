        <div>
          <p>When looking back in time and thinking where my design path started I have to refer back to my Sophomore year in high school when I moved to the United States from Finland and started taking my first Art classes. I was lucky enough to have the professors to help me to find my visual talent. In my path toward my personal artistic development, the encouragement with which I took solace was brought to me through passionate professors, the likes of which helped me realize my aptitude for visual art.  Although, art has always been more than just a visual talent to me, through art I was able to express myself and have an individual voice.  When I moved to the United States I didn&rsquo;t speak English and connecting with people was difficult. Art and especially Graphic Design was the language for me that made it possible to connect and make new friends. Graphic Design has become a proven medium for my self expression, as it is one that has the ability to universally convey a message while evading the language barrier that I had previously struggled with coming from Finland and not speaking English well. My professors and classmates became my support system and I am lucky to have been surrounded by such amazing people, they have made my four years of College unforgettable. </p>
          <p>This experience has afforded me the opportunity to form enriching and supportive relationships within the confines of NESAD and beyond, which have greatly impacted both my artistic creativity and my college experience.
            Thank you Guys!</p>
          <p>For the future I would like to stay in the United States and to be able to fulfill my goals in my design career by bringing together the minimalistic, abstract and structured Finland with the bold, funky and colorful United States.</p>
