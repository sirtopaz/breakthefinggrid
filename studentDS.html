          <p>University is easy. It’s like riding a bike. And the bike is on fire. And the ground is on fire. And everything is on fire because you’re in hell.» My college years were not easy at all. I was born in Russia and moved to Boston when I had just turned 18. I came here without my parents, just with a few friends. They left a year after so I had to struggle and deal with obstacles on my own. I think this was a huge life lesson for me that made me stronger and more responsible. I transferred to Suffolk University from Bunker Hill Community College in 2013 and Graphic Design was not my first major. Before, when I had graduated from high school I didn’t know what I wanted to do in the future, so I decided to start my education with an International Business major and see if that was my path or not. Well, guess what? It wasn’t. So, I transferred to a Graphic Design major right after my first semester. I didn’t like my boring economics and accounting classes; I wanted to do something fun and creative. When I transferred to Graphic Design, I opened up a whole new world for myself, in which anyone can transmit his or her thoughts and feelings through art and if you can’t say it - you can show or visualize it. I wanted my professors to know me personally; I wanted to create a strong relationship and connection between professors and myself. I met so many talented and fantastic people who inspired me to keep going and keep improving myself. After graduation, I am planning to travel around the world to get some inspiration from different people and cultures because the graphic design world changes every single moment and as much as it is an independent type of art, it is also changing depending on others spheres in art, culture and the world. For me, being a graphic designer is to be a very versatile person; you have to get your feet wet in different aspects of this world. For example, I really love art history, literature, geography and science and I think sometimes these interests really help me stay inspired and work on my projects. I want to thank all the people I’ve met on my graphic design path. You were very helpful and motivating. </p>
