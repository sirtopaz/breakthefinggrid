        <h4>Statement</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Growing up in Boston, I have a connection to this city and the variety of creative productions that come out of it. Boston offers so much good entertainment, from theatre and ballet to concerts of any genre. Working in the nightlife industry as a bartender and hula hoop dance performer I have learned a great deal about what goes in to making an incredible experience for a client. The theatrics that go into my work in this industry carry over into my design work. Depending on where I am working, I have to present a certain persona to the client to offer them exactly the experience they have come to expect from a venue. Becoming familiar with the patron&rsquo;s expectations is a crucial part of delivering an outstanding product. Similarly to my art, it is imperative I become familiar with my client in order to connect the visual to the product. </p>
          <p>As and active performer in the nightlife scene, my creative interests lie heavily in the entertainment industry. Advertising and promoting for both my own performances and local events in the city gives me the ability to merge my passion for visual and performance art. Being extremely interested in the &ldquo;nuts &amp; bolts&rdquo; of this industry connects me to the backbone of productions and helps me build a bridge to connect dance, theatre, and music to illustration and design. My love for performing, along with that for drawing and painting allows me to use my own illustrations to bring my personality to every piece. My performance is a very personal expression of myself and I try to bring that emotional connection to every aspect of my creative life. My ideal career would give me the opportunity to be designing for theatres, films, and musicians, and possibly even myself as a performer. It would give me the opportunity to be passionate and personally connected to my work from more directions than just the visually creative.</p>
