        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Morocco is a center of cultural exchange due to its unique geographical location. For centuries it was the bridge between Europe and Africa. Influenced by these two cultures in addition to the traditions of Islam, the Arabs who emigrated, Jews and Berber Morocco was considered to be a cultural and artistic melting pot. I was born in this country. I grew up admiring the different ceramic designs in houses, and the gypsum sculptures that decorated the ceilings. I walked in the street of different cities and was mesmerized by the creativeness of the handcrafters. Each city had a unique sense of art that was influenced by its residents and the location. All these were factors that shaped my creative thinking and made it unique. I grew up appreciating different cultures and their arts. </p>
          <p>In addition to being part of an artistic culture, my uncle was a plaster and ceramic designer. His studio was a color palette. I was fascinated by the colors, patterns and the different arrangements of the plaster that he made. I knew right then that I want to be like my uncle but in a different way. I knew I wanted to make my own patterns using my own palette of colors. </p>
          <p>My journey with design and arts started in my uncle&rsquo;s studio. Since then I decided to pursue graphic design and take my cultural heritage as my inspiration. After high school I studied metal construction design. I got certified in AutoCAD and decided to put my certification into good use. I started working as a designer for an architecture company. A year later I had the opportunity to come to the USA. Once I got here without hesitation I went to register for a graphic design program. My first stop was at Bunker Hill Community College, two years later I transferred to Suffolk University. For the first time I felt like my dreams are coming true. Attending Suffolk has given me the opportunity to improve and grow in a field that I love and enjoy every aspect of. I was given many opportunities to work on my skills through classes and internships. It certainly helped me push my design threshold to a much higher level. </p>
          <p> I continue to aspire to reach the highest levels in my field. I hope to land a great job after graduation that will allow me to apply what I learned during my school years. A job that I can also learn from and that will allow me to grow both personally and professionally. </p>
