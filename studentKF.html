            It seemed to be confusion and uncertainty that guided me to where I am now, confusion of what I wanted, and who I wanted to be.  Confusion carried me to one university, and one career path, while uncertainty pulled me to another. At this new school, confusion lead me to one major disguised as the career path I thought I wanted, but uncertainty had something else in mind. I soon found a friend named decision and with its help I was finally starting to guide myself.

            When I first started in the graphic design program, I really didn't know much about design; I had no idea how to use any of the programs! Truthfully, graphic design was something I sort of stumbled into. I have always loved art and drawing, but design as a career choice had never crossed my mind. The project that really got me thinking and excited about design was called finding your visual voice. This project really helped me understand how I visualize my surroundings as well as myself. Progressively, I began to get more excited about working on projects. Through my designs I want to convey positive messages as often as possible, inspire and intrigue those looking at my work. Decision is a great friend to have because it has taught me to better trust my judgment and knowledge in all choices that I make. I am excited to try and find ways to put a bit of my own style into every piece I create. The more I think about it, the more motivated I am to try new styles and push my ways of thinking beyond my comfort zone
