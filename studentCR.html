          <p>I was lucky enough to have my Grandmother living upstairs from us when I was a child. She was kind and patient and would do anything for me. Her artistic talents were passed on to me. She was a very avid painter. She introduced me to drawing from life as soon as I could hold a pencil. She showed me how to use her watercolor set, well, she let me make a mess of it.</p>
          <p>These fond memories would stay with me through high school and are still with me even though she is no longer here. She would have been proud to see me receive the &ldquo;Best Artist Award&rdquo; in my graduating class of 350 plus people, go to Montserrat College of Art, and now to Suffolk University for a Certificate in Graphic Design. </p>
          <p>At first I was worried that I would be out of my element­­, going back to school with people nearly half my age who grew up on the internet. But my fears quickly diminished when I realized we were all here for the same thing, to learn the principles of good graphic design.  I flourished around all the other creatives. I have always had a wild imagination, usually steering away from the norm, definitely not following the crowd. I have a good moral compass. This is true for most artists. We listen to our gut, and listen and observe the world around us. It was encouraging to be with a group of people like that.</p>
          <p>Helping people is what makes me tick. I enjoy teaching art to kids and young adults, but more importantly, trying to teach them to be good human beings in the process. I would like to get a job with a non profit. I recently interned at English at Large, which is a non profit that acquires volunteers to teach people English who don&rsquo;t have the financial means to pay for classes. Designing advertisements, booklets and flyers to obtain volunteers was my main task. I found this to be more interesting and rewarding than say creating a financial statement for a Fortune 500 company.</p>
          <p>I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to go back to school. I can appreciate it more after being in the workplace for many years. There is so much more I can do now with the graphic design skills I have learned. Paired with my real world experience, common sense, and painting and photography skills, the possibilities are endless. </p>
