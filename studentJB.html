        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <div>
          <p>I first came to NESAD as an Interior Design student (hahaha). Every day I spent up on the fourth floor my freshman year; I lost a piece of myself as well as my sanity. By spring semester, I was the most miserable student living in 1flithy Tremont. Every &ldquo;friend&rdquo; I made there told me I resembled a Boston Common squirrel thrown into a bucket of ice water (or some rendition of that story).</p>
           <p> After a number of my foundation professors questioned me about my major, I started having second thoughts. Most of them were telling me to look into either graphic design or illustration. I was already kind of into illustration, but wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was ready to make it my life. I soon realized that graphic design incorporated many of the elements I enjoy about art and design. </p>
          <p>I decided to change my major. The second I did was like a life changing scene out of a movie. Seriously, like, picture that Boston Common squirrel and in an instant, the squirrel transforms into a well-fed suburban squirrel with beautiful, shiny fur (slight breeze, birds chirping). </p>
          <p>Graphic design gives me the ability to experiment with both hands on, traditional mediums as well as create pieces with structure and reasoning. To me, that feels limitless. Everyday I find something that inspires me so much, whether it&rsquo;s details in typography or some really clever packaging. It always surprises me how passionate I can be about small aspects of the field like that, or just the field as a whole.</p>
          <p>For now, my plan is to travel. I love branding, so I am hoping to start out at a larger advertising agency or marketing consultant. I want to be doing something I will never get bored of; so having many clients to work with will be the best way to explore new styles and techniques. Bigger agencies, especially in the city, tend to have multiple locations either nation wide or world wide, which would be a great opportunity to explore culturally as well.</p>
          <p>Moral of the story, don&rsquo;t settle being a Boston Common squirrel. Find something that makes you feel like shiny suburban squirrel, or Beyonc√©.</p>
