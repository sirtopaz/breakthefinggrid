        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Hey I&rsquo;m Abel Mujo</p>
          <p>Born and raised in Boston, Ma.  Growing up I was so into outside activity&rsquo;s I loved to rollerblade, bike ride, fishing, and going to the beach or lake. Until I began to outgrow from all of that and all I wanted to do was to just hangout with my friends, eat, sleep, and play video games.  Till one day my aunt who worked in a factory where she manufacture hard cover sketch books brought me three to do my homework in, which I did not use for instead I just began to draw in them. That&rsquo;s when I began to get into art as I began my freshmen year in high school.  In high school I took a few art classes that sparked my interest even more but I wasn&rsquo;t so sure I would want to do the whole college thing after I graduated. I always felt like I never amounted to anything while I was in high school, I wasn&rsquo;t into math, history, or science, I wasn&rsquo;t a straight A student; as my mom always wished that I was I would just go to school to hangout, go to class, eat lunch, and then head home. I would try but not hard enough. </p>
          <p>Once I graduated I had no plans for collage till my parents told me I should go at least to a 2-year program or something not to long. They where always insisting to head towards the medical field. I passed out one summer while watching a gory movie called HOSTLE so the medical field was definitely not an option for me. All I knew was that I wanted to have fun and live a happy life doing what I wanted to do. I told them I was into art and I would like study graphic design. They dint seem to thrilled about it but they been supporting me ever since I mentioned it.  </p>
